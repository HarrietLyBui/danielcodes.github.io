## Humble beginnings

I *first learned to type* and then learned to program. I remember when I was still in High School a couple years back (wow, more than 5!) whenever I had the need to type papers or anything on the computer, I would type.. like a noob. I did a bit better than hunt and peck as I used more than just my index fingers to type but I was heavily dissatisfied with the way I typed. And so I decided to change things, there had to be a *correct way to type*, and ther was, it is called **touch typing**. Touch typing is the ability to type using all ten fingers without looking at the keyboard. When I first read about it, I was pretty amazed, and I quickly jumped on to learning. Except that I didn't, well not right away at least.

## Introducing Dvorak

Around this same time, I was into cubing (only 3x3). I followed this guy, Shotaro Makisumi, who had set various records at the beginning of the scene. Interestingly enough, as I read through his website there was a section on Dvorak. Here I was, having just found out about this magical keyboard layout and on my quest to learn to touch type. Coincidence? Maybe. Things simply happened. So began my quest to touch type and learning Dvorak. It was a very frustrating experience at first. I was not a touch typer and learning a keystroke at a time really tested my patience. However, once I had learned the home row keys (10 keys), things started to get fun! In Dvorak, all the consonants are placed on your left hand side, so you lots of words are readily available without lifting a finger unlike it's counterpart QWERTY. After about a month or so of practicing (yeah, I took my time), I was finally able to touch type in Dvorak! It was an amazing feeling, it still is an amazing feeling everyday I get to type in this beautifully laid out set of letters. My words-per-minute (WPM) also skyrocketed from about 35-40 to about 60. It was pretty life changing. I mean let's face it, the past couple of years has been a lot of staring at the computer and a lot of typing.
