I previously wrote about having my productivity on tilt. This week, I slowly started to turn things around. The answer was simple, I just found work to do. It's pretty easy nowadays. Whether working on a new project, learning a tip or two from blog posts, reading books, etc. Most importantly, the thing that really helped me find my groove was writing. Writing forces you to make time and __do__, it helps with discipline. And once you get the discipline ball rolling, it's hard to stop. 

The things that I have been recently working on are:

* My kendama collection app, https://github.com/danielcodes/kendama-collection
* Finishing the Free Code Camp zipline projects, https://github.com/danielcodes/fcc-projects/tree/master/front-end-dev-projects 
* And jotting down nuggets of knowledge, https://github.com/danielcodes/today-i-learned 

I ran into a bit of a wall while working on the Wikipedia search project, diving into the documentation was super dense and I have been avoiding it like the plague but I finally told myself that I should wrap it up and move on. What really helped was asking for help on the Gitter chat. As a senior student, I sometimes feel too arrogant to ask for help and that is a BIG mistake. Although Google is great, getting direct hints from others who have ran into these problems provides you with way better feedback.

That was all a bit too weird. To conclude, write more, get disciplined through writing and just find joy in the work.
