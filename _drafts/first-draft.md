### The decision

Last month, I set a goal to keep a GitHub streak, that is a commit a day. There were a couple of reasons that led to this decision:

* practice ABC (always be coding)
* work on more projects

There's probably more, but those are the main ones. I had gotten into programming a bit late, if I wanted to keep up I needed to be constantly improving my skills. 

### What I've learned

I have managed to push a commit for the past 40 days

I can't say that I have managed to stay 100% true to my goal but I do have some interesting feedback. Setting the goal in itself was easy, so that was easiest part, cutting the mental barrier. I also told myself that I wouldn't push out stupid commits, as in commits that didn't really count, my commits would be meaningful (or at least I would hope so). It is super hard to push out meaningful commits on a daily basis, coding is something that requires you to sit for an uninterrupted amount of time and just fight through problems. As fun as this is, I didn't always find the time to sit and think and program. And thus I cheated. But not really. The projects I worked on through the month of March were not really big projects so there wasn't a need to place it in a GitHub repo. There were mostly small tasks for which CodePen sufficed. And so I kept a log of the projects links in a GitHub repo to the CodePen projects. The rest of my commits came from a TIL (today i learned) repo that I started for myself as I am reading more about programming, I like jot down the little nuggets of knowledge and going through the snippets of code is good practice. Lastly, writing blog posts also counted as a form of commit since this page is hosted on a GitHub repo.

### What can be improved

This model is not perfect. I understand that the commits don't seem super meaningful but I have managed to find some work arounds that still center on me learning a bit of code everyday. Things to improve on include finding more of that quiet time where I can just sit uninterrupted and code away at a project. This is the most meaningful way to push commits and level up.
