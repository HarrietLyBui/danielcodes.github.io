### Free Code Camp

I started the Free Code Camp curriculum back in March. Reason was to brush on some Javascript, I mainly focused on attacking the algorithms sections, but soon found myself just wanting to finish everything.

The projects, I have done so far are:

* Tribute page
* Personal Portfolia Webpage
* Random Quote Machine
* Local weather
* Wikipedia viewer
* Twitch.tv viewer (in the works)

Links to the codepens can be found on [this page](https://github.com/danielcodes/fcc-projects/tree/master/front-end-dev-projects).

Web application that creates a visual of the stages of a process. The process chosen was a news aggregator that collected articles from RSS feeds.
