title: Thoughts on hackathons

This weekend I had the pleasure of attending my second hackathon, HackNY Spring 2016. The first one I attended was in the summer, AngelHack Brooklyn 2015. This time around, things were a bit tougher, it wasn't all smooth sailing and I just want to write about things that I could have done better in terms of preparation and on-site.

### Decide on a goal

Hackathons have prizes, these come in two kinds, specific categories (design, technical, etc) and technology specific (companies want you to use their API's). Before entering the hackathon, you should have made up your mind as to what your target is. Of course, this also implies that you must have an idea that you want to work on. This was my team's biggest setback during the hackathon, we did not have a concrete idea to work with and were pivoting from time to time resulting lots of wasted time and energy that could have been better used for development.

### Try to sleep?

I believe that I only got about 40 minutes of sleep that night. These 24-hour hackathons encourage you to code through the night and you probably will since you want to win (duh) are pretty damn exhausting. In fact, I was dozing off near the end of the demos. Once I got home, I could not wait to close my eyes and just get some rest. I crashed from 7 PM to 8 AM the next day. Be aware that hackathons do have a high burnout rate. Though I guess it's ok, since it is a once in a while thing.

### Conclusion

This hackathon was specially tough since my team had gone in with the goal to win (what team doesn't) but came up short. The biggest downfall was being prize-driven and trying to create an idea out of a narrow set of contraints (API's) rather than letting an idea open up our creativity.

PS. Despite the negative tone, hackathons are hella fun and you should try them out if you get the chance :)
