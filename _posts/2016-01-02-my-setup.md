The first laptop I bought, a [Lenovo Y40](http://www.cnet.com/products/lenovo-y40-70-laptop-59423030-black-doorbuster-4th-generation-intel-core-i7-4510u-2-00ghz-1600-mhz-4mb/specs/), turned out to be horrible disappointment. From a keyboard that I didn't like, a screen resolution that sucked and to top things off the battery died on me after 5 months of usage. It didn't completely die on me, but the darn machine would not work unless it was plugged in. Rendering my laptop's portability useless, as everytime I'd need ot use it, boot up was necessary. I sent in the laptop since it was still under warranty but I was still in need of a laptop for my coding needs as school was already in session.

I first resorted to borrowing a friend's tiny notebook. It was a really tiny machine with Ubuntu on it, ultimately the laptop's keyboard was too small and the fan noise was irritable enough to keep me from using it. But I'd found something cool, that Linux could run on machines with minimal specs!

I started looking around for cheap computer options, and eventually after much fishing, chose to buy a used ThinkPad T420. You can find these [under 200 on ebay](http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_trksid=p2050601.m570.l1311.R1.TR12.TRC2.A0.H0.Xthinkpad+t.TRS0&_nkw=thinkpad+t420&_sacat=0). I coughed up a tiny bit more to get one that wasn't too beat up. The specs were decent, i5, 250GB storage and 4GB RAM, more than enough for any Linux OS. After receiving the computer, I instantly liked it a lot more than the being-repaired Y40. The screen was still mediocre but the keyboard made a world's difference. One thing that I can't stand is having a shortened right SHIFT key. Exactly what the Y40 had, and to add onto the bad design, the keys had the depth of about a nanometer. This ThinkPad had the old school IBM keyboards, it felt clicky, and the right SHIFT was not shortened. The only downside is that, it is literally a brick to carry around.

Soon after, a friend helped me install Linux on it, specifically [Ubuntu-GNOME](https://ubuntugnome.org/). It felt good to finally work in this OS after many failed attempts to get it on VirtualBox. Not that I failed, the VM's ran so slow (2 - 3 second delays), that it was pretty unbearable so I gave up on it. Then I found about Vagrant + Cygwin, which initially cost me a lot of grief (it lost my VM at some point). But I did have Linux-y tools for a brief period of time (troubled times with symlinks and shared folders).

I really can't emphasize how good it is once you make the switch to a Linux OS. I'm being biased here, as I've always wanted this environment where I can just do all my work in a terminal. But if you're a developer or an aspiring programmer, definitely try it out this set up if you have 200 bucks to spare.

**TL;DR** Don't be fooled by a laptop's specs. If you just want to program, buy a cheap Thinkpad and throw Linux on it. Or get a Mac if you can afford it.
