title: Being dumb, painful Jekyll setup

Incredibly annoyed that it took me so long to set things up with jekyll here.
I began customization through the index page, making edits to the html and every darn time I restarted the server, the changes would never go through. It was by chance that I decided to mess with the **_config.yml** file and found that some parameters defined here were being passed to the index. This meant that no matter how many times I changed the html itself, it would just get replaced, every single time. I stupidly googled "jekyll not saving changes" too. All I can say is...
