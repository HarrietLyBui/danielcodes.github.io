title: An unhealthy amount of screen time 
---

It's Christmas morning, so Merry Christmas!

Today I want to share my insight on eye strain. I fully knew this, that before committing myself to become a software developer, that I'd have to spend endless time in front of computer. Although I've been trying methods here and there to manage this unhealthy, almost unavoidable habit, I always seem to break right back in. The bad habit is to sit in front of a computer for a solid 2-3 hours. This adds up if it's happening on a daily basis (which it is).

I've always had the thought of eye health in the back of my mind, but it wasn't until recently that it hit me, with a vengeance. Of course, it happened during finals week. For the past week, I've spent an insane amonut of time in front of the screen. I was mildly aware until I took a look in the mirror and saw how bad my eyes looked, they were bloodshot. I looked like Patrick. To make things worse, I started rubbing them and this is a no-no since it'll make it itch more and thus continue the vicious cycle. Since the semester is over, and I didn't feel like kicking back and rather learn all of the things that I've been wanting to learn. This led to more computer time, so the eye strain symptoms have started again.

This is a serious problem, if my eyes are bad how am I supposed write code? From now on, I'll be prioritizing my eye health. My plan is to have 1 hour bursts of productivity and then taking 10-15 minute breaks.
