		Right after my finals ended I thought about how to maximize my productivity during this upcoming winter break. I started reading articles on Medium, about the latest programming craze. Of course, it turned out to be Javascript. Although I&#39;ve dabbed into the language, can&#39;t say that I have full understanding of it. This left a bad taste whenever I&#39;d have to write Javascript. I read The Good Parts by Douglas Crockford, some bits resonated while...

		It&#39;s Christmas morning, so Merry Christmas! Today I want to share my insight on eye strain. I fully knew this, that before committing myself to become a software developer, that I&#39;d have to spend endless time in front of computer. Although I&#39;ve been trying methods here and there to manage this unhealthy, almost unavoidable habit, I always seem to break right back in. The bad habit is to sit in front of a computer for...

		I&#39;ve been wanting to write this one for a while now. This summer, I got learn two very exciting tools, Vim an Tmux. These two are a must-have for any terminal junkie and together they&#39;ve taken my workflow to a whole new level. Although tmux has some extended functionality, in this post I am going to focus on how I personally use it. Also, I am going to assume that you&#39;ve installed the tool on...

		It&#39;s been one heck of a semester. From thinking, &#39;oh it&#39;s going to be fun learning this and that&#39; to &#39;shit, I have to get this and that done&#39;, see the difference, not much fun. While I underestimated the semester&#39;s course load, I&#39;d say that I&#39;ve improved in other aspects. Those being controlling my temper when things go wrong and maintaining a healthy lifestyle.  I&#39;d like to address the first, my temper. Ever since...

		This semester I had to partake in 2 group projects. Both of which I ended up taking leadership roles in, AKA Project Management. Up until now, other than writing I haven&#39;t really collaborated much on any other type of project. For this 2 projects, one of them involved mostly writing and the second was software collaboration. I can&#39;t say that it has been easy nor I&#39;ve done a great job at it, all I can...
