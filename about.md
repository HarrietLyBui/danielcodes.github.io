Hi, I'm Daniel Chia. I am currently a Computer Engineering student at City College of New York. Mostly spending my time in front of a computer learning to code from all over the web. At the moment (Fall 2015) focusing on learning Python, using the Django web framework.

Things I like include, Kendama, Weightlifting and FOOOOOOD.

Thanks for visiting!
