Hi, I'm Daniel Chia. I am currently a Computer Engineering undergraduate senior at the City College of New York. I like most things involved with programming, new languages, the command line, and sharing what I've learned, thus the purpose of this blog. Mostly doing Python things, and currently learning Javascript. 

Besides coding, I like to read, play kendama, sports (basketball & tennis), and last but not least, eat all kinds of food.

Thanks for visiting!
