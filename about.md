Hi, I'm Daniel Chia. I am currently a Computer Engineering student at City College of New York. Mostly spending my time in front of a computer learning to code from all over the web. At the moment (Fall 2015) my focus is on learning Python, specifically creating web applications through the Django framework.

Besides coding, I like to read, play kendama, sports (basketball & tennis), and last but not least, eat all kinds of food.

Thanks for visiting!
