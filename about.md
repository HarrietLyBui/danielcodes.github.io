Hi, I'm Daniel Chia. I am currently a Computer Engineering undergraduate senior at the City College of New York. I like most things involved with programming, new languages, the command line, and sharing what I've learned, thus the purpose of this blog. My first programming language was C++, where I learned basics such as Data Structures and Algorithms. Soon after I picked up some Java. Now, I am mostly interested in writing Python and Javascript as my focus is on Web Development.

Besides coding, I like to read, play kendama, sports (basketball & tennis), and last but not least, eat all kinds of food.

Thanks for visiting!
